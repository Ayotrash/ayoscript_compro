> Software Development Company

We created all project with love and strategy :heart:

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

<small>Note: we recommended to use npm :pray:</small> 

##### Use Https

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ayotrash/ayoscript_compro.git
cd ayoscript_compro/
npm install
```

##### Use SSH

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ayotrash/ayoscript_compro.git
cd awesome-project/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, use:

##### Development Mode

```shell
npm start dev 
```

or

##### Production Mode

```shell
npm start
```

And open http://localhost:3000 for seeing Ayoscript project.

### Add to git and push
After you've filled your README.md file with your own project's text, you should push it to your GitHub project:

```shell
git add . # add_all_changes
git commit -m "\${your-message}" # add_commits
git push # push_to_github
```

This adds the README.md file to your git repository, creates a commit for it and pushes it to GitHub (or other preferred remote repository).

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://ayoscript.com/
- Repository: https://github.com/Ayotrash/ayoscript_compro
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/Ayotrash/ayoscript_compro/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    info@ayotrust.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!

## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
